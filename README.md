Hi, I’m Simon Lucas. I am a young aspiring Animation Graduate from Loyalist College and Munster Technological University. Unemployed at the moment.
I am interested in coding and development and want to include it to my array of skills. I have done coding before, C++ (High School) and HTML, Scratch and Python (College).

I’m currently learning JavaScript and how to work with GitHub. I am taking part in Promineo Tech's Front End Development Course.
